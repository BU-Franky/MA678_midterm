## Abstract

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America, which is absolutely the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. However, in 2020-2021 season, the highest paid player is Golden States top star, Stephen Curry, who earned a salary over 40,000,000 dollars while the lowest paid player's salary is around 150,000 dollars. Thus, here comes the problem: which kind of player is favored most in NBA currently or which kind of player can sign a big NBA contract.
